# FourPlaygames.py

Welcome to the FourPlay Game project! This is a Python-based implementation of the classic Connect Four game, with a unique twist. The game is designed for two players who take turns dropping colored discs into a vertical grid, aiming to be the first to connect four of their discs in a row, column, or diagonal.

## Features

- **Two-Player Mode**: Enjoy the game with a friend, taking turns to play.
- **Interactive Gameplay**: Simple text-based interface for easy interaction.
- **Clear Instructions**: Easy to follow and understand, making it accessible for all ages.
- **Clean and Modular Code**: Well-structured and documented codebase, ideal for learning and customization.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your system.

### Installation


1. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:

    ```bash
    cd fourplay-game
    ```

2. **Run the Game**:

    ```bash
    python fourplay.py
    ```

## How to Play

1. **Start the Game**: Launch the game by running the `fourplay.py` script.
2. **Take Turns**: Player 1 and Player 2 will take turns selecting a column to drop their disc.
3. **Win the Game**: The first player to connect four discs in a line (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.
4. **Draw**: If the grid is filled and no player has connected four discs, the game ends in a draw.

## Code Structure

- `fourplay.py`: Main script that runs the game.
- `game_logic.py`: Contains the core logic for checking valid moves, updating the grid, and determining the winner.
